# gnn-noisy-labels

After a week of extreme work and no resting at all, at the very end of the deadline I subimtted my best result that went over the real baseline for the public set. After that i have collapsed out of tireness. Couldnt adapt the main.py code but i uploaded models and notebook. I am currently in the orcoess of building the main.py and will have it working as soon as possible.
